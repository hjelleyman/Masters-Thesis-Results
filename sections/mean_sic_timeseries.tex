\section{Time series}
\subsection{Nimbus-7 seaice timeseries}
Below are the mean SIC time series for seaice in Antarctica. All of these are produced from the NSIDC dataset with different variations of post-processing.

\foreach\tempres in {monthly,seasonal,annual}{%
	\foreach\decomp in {raw,anomalous}{%
		\foreach\tempdecomp in {raw, detrended}{%
		\begin{figure}[H]
		\includegraphics{images/timeseries/SIC/\decomp_\tempres_1_\tempdecomp_nsidc}
		\caption{Mean \decomp\ \tempres\ \tempdecomp\ SIC in Antarctica from the NSIDC dataset.}
		\end{figure}
		}%
	}%
}

\subsection{ERA5 seaice timeseries}
Below are the mean SIC time series for seaice in Antarctica. All of these are produced from the ECMWF ERA5 dataset with different variations of post-processing.

\foreach\tempres in {monthly,seasonal,annual}{%
	\foreach\decomp in {raw,anomalous}{%
		\foreach\tempdecomp in {raw, detrended}{%
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\includegraphics{images/timeseries/SIC/\decomp_\tempres_1_\tempdecomp_ecmwf}
				\caption{Mean \decomp\ \tempres\ \tempdecomp\ SIC in Antarctica from the ECMWF ERA5 dataset.}
			\end{figure}
		}%
	}%
}




\subsection{Comparison of datasets}
We can plot these time series together to look at how similar they are.
\foreach\tempres in {monthly,seasonal,annual}{%
	\foreach\decomp in {raw,anomalous}{%
		\foreach\tempdecomp in {raw, detrended}{%
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\includegraphics{images/timeseries/SIC/SIC_ERA5_\decomp_\tempres_1_\tempdecomp}
				\caption{Comparison of mean \decomp\ \tempres\ \tempdecomp\ SIC in Antarctica datasets.}
			\end{figure}
